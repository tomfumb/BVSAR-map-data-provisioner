# Disabled isort on pre-commit due to conflicts.
# Encountered a situation in which neither pre-commit hook could complete because both modified the same import block in different ways.
# This discussion https://github.com/psf/black/issues/333 indicates that an upcoming version of isort may have a black-compatible profile.
