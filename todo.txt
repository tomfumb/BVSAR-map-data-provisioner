- transparency on black in Warped images can be fixed by using translate instead. Just have to give projwin and projwinsrs where projwin is the min of the bbox or the raster extent
- merge bc-hillshade files in run directory to avoid edge overlap effect
- provide count and current bbox being provisioned
- disable controls on upload, sho w some visual feedback
- can bbox provisioning be multiprocess forked, with optional disable for dev/debug? Could eliminate some downtime from the provisioning process
- lighter colours / casing for trails and waterways on dark xyz imagery
- namespace env vars with BVSAR_ for cleaner use on other systems
- xyz attribution required
- versioning in UI
- Additional cabins from Ben
- pyproj suppress warnings when exporting proj4
- move from common to profiles/common where appropriate
- try to detect stalled tilemill issue 
- os-specific conda environment files
- refuse to run if annual data is not updated
- WMS retriever should use separate types for ImageRequirement and PartialCoverageTile as they are different things
- need some consistency in class file names, classes having their own files
